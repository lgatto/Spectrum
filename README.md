# Low level infrastructure to store and handle single MS spectra

Sandbox package to experiment with a new implementation of `Spectrum`
objects defined in the `MSnbase` package.

The content of this package could either survive as its own package or
be phagocyted back into by `MSnbase` or `Spectra`.
